# London Undergorund Quality Report

This project analyses the London underground's performance data between the years of 2004 to 2017
from various categories across multiple years to identify trends and answer the question - 
Has the London Undergound's servicies improved over the year? 

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/SmartDeveloped/Data5902>
   
2. Install Dependencies
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required Python libraries:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   This will have:
   •   pandas
   •   numpy
   •   pytest
   •   matplotlib
   •   scipy
   

4. Run the Main Script

   python analyse_data.py

   This will:
	•	Load the dataset.
	•	Perform the analysis.
	•	Generate visualisations (line graphs, boxplots, and regression plots).

## How to Test:

   python test_analyse_data.py

   Ensure that the following functionalities are tested:
	•	Loading and filtering the dataset.
	•	Creating line graphs.
	•	Creating boxplots.
	•	Creating linear regression plots.

## Results: 

   This project provides insights into performance data by visualising:
	1.	Trends over time (line graphs).
	2.	Distributions across categories (boxplots).
	3.	Relationships between variables (linear regression).

Visualisations
	1.	Line Graphs:
	•	Visualise trends in categories like Power Failure or Signals.
	2.	Boxplots:
	•	Compare the distribution of categories across 12 years.
	3.	Linear Regression:
	•	Examine relationships, e.g., between Staff Absence and London Underground Operations.
